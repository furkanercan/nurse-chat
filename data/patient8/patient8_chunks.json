Despite physical limitations, he tries to follow healthcare recommendations and is proactive in managing his care. However, he is unable to care for his bilateral pressure ulcers over his ischial tuberosities. He depends on his parents to help him with ADLs, position changes, and daily wound care. He states that he understands the importance of ADLs, frequent position changes, and daily wound care. Also, he reports that his parents lack the physical strength and endurance to effectively meet his daily care needs and that he understands the associated risks with this limitation. Currently, he and his family cannot afford to hire help, but he is hopeful he can afford home health care with the income from his new job."
