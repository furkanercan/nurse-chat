    "demographics": "Charley Bob is a 45-year-old Native American male, born on October 10, 1980. He stands 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 190 pounds. He is non-Hispanic, Christian, and college-educated. His immunizations are up to date. Charley is allergic to stone fruits, which trigger generalized urticaria. His attending provider is Dr. Alkim Kurt, and he can be reached at 944-398-2465.",
    "social_background": "Charley is actively engaged in his healthcare and attends all scheduled appointments. He takes his medications as prescribed and follows clinical recommendations to the best of his ability. However, due to physical limitations, he is unable to care for his bilateral pressure ulcers located over the ischial tuberosities. He depends on his elderly parents for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs), position changes, and wound care. Charley understands the importance of proper care but acknowledges that his parents’ limited physical strength presents a risk to his health. Although the family cannot currently afford professional help, he is optimistic that income from his new remote job will eventually allow him to hire home healthcare services.",
    "family_history": "Charley’s mother is 74 years old and has hypertension. His father is 78 and has a history of colon cancer. His brother, age 47, lives with hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. On the maternal side, his grandmother had hypertension, and his grandfather had cirrhosis. On the paternal side, his grandfather had congestive heart failure and hypertension. His paternal grandmother is deceased, though no specific condition was recorded.",
    "medical_history": "Charley has a history of chronic pressure ulcers on his bilateral ischial tuberosities, first documented on August 15, 2024. He also suffers from left-sided hemiparesis and ataxia, both resulting from a subarachnoid hemorrhage that occurred on January 1, 2023. He has stage 1 hypertension, diagnosed in May 2005.",
    "mental_health": "Charley experiences frustration related to his physical limitations, which has negatively impacted his mental well-being. Nonetheless, he finds motivation in being able to work remotely and is determined to regain more independence through physical and occupational therapy.",
    "functional_status": "Charley is currently bedfast and has very limited mobility. He requires assistance for most position changes, although he can make small movements of his extremities on his own. For ambulation, he relies on a walker and his mother's help. He attends biweekly physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) sessions in hopes of improving his functional capacity.",
    "appointments_and_support": "Charley’s primary caregivers are his parents. He consistently attends scheduled healthcare appointments, including PT, OT, and medical follow-ups. He remains hopeful that his new remote job will provide the financial means to support additional care in the future.",
    "surgical_history": "Charley underwent an odontotomy in 1995.",
    "er_admission": "Charley presented to the emergency department today with a suspected case of sepsis. His National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is 5. The likely source of infection is a pressure ulcer located over his left ischial tuberosity.",
    "labs_and_vitals": "Charley's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/mm³, which is elevated and may suggest an underlying infection such as sepsis. Other blood values including hemoglobin (13.2 g/dL), hematocrit (44%), red blood cells (5.5 million/mcL), MCV (95 fL), MCH (30 pg), RDW (13.5%), and platelet count (375,000) are all within or near normal limits, supporting stable hematologic function. His comprehensive metabolic panel is unremarkable. Glucose is at the lower end of normal at 90 mg/dL. Electrolytes and kidney/liver function values—such as sodium (142 mEq/L), potassium (4.0 mEq/L), creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), ALT (26 U/L), and AST (25 U/L)—are all within standard reference ranges. Urinalysis results are normal with clear yellow urine, a specific gravity of 1.025, pH of 7.1, and negligible red and white blood cells. Both urine and blood cultures are currently pending with expected results being negative.",
    "medications_and_treatment": "Charley is prescribed a balanced diet with no restrictions, although his activity is restricted due to being bedfast. His current medication regimen includes oral doses of Lisinopril 10 mg and Rivaroxaban 10 mg, both administered at 8:00 AM, along with a daily multivitamin. For infection management, he receives IV Vancomycin at 0900 and 2100 (15 mg/kg) and IV Cefepime 2 g at 0900, 1700, and 0100. He also receives IV acetaminophen 650 mg as needed every 4 hours for pain or fever. Hydration is maintained via normal saline infusions—500 mL doses scheduled four times a day and 250 mL as needed. Bowel care is supported with PR docusate sodium (283 mg/5 mL), administered as needed every 8 hours.",
    "nutrition_and_gi": "Charley follows a balanced diet with no specific dietary restrictions. His overall nutritional intake is managed in accordance with physician orders. While no GI complaints have been documented, his use of docusate sodium suggests a need for stool softening, possibly due to reduced mobility and associated constipation risk. No appetite issues or GI intolerance have been noted.",
    "urinary_and_bowel": "There are no explicit urinary symptoms reported in the record, but the presence of a suspected infection in a pressure ulcer may imply careful monitoring of elimination function. Charley is prescribed PR docusate sodium, indicating he may be at risk for constipation, likely due to limited mobility. Bowel and bladder routines are not described in detail, but it can be inferred he may require assistance with toileting due to being bedfast.",
    "sensory_and_sleep": "There are no documented sensory deficits; hence, Charley likely retains intact vision and hearing. His sleep status isn't directly addressed, but his bedfast condition and ongoing sepsis evaluation may contribute to fatigue, disrupted sleep, or hospital-related restlessness.",
    "wound_and_skin": "Charley has very limited sensory perception; he responds only to painful stimuli and cannot effectively communicate discomfort except through moaning or restlessness. His skin is frequently moist, requiring linen changes at least once per shift. He is bedfast and unable to walk, with severely limited mobility—capable of only slight, infrequent changes in position. Nutritionally, his intake is considered adequate; he eats more than half of most meals and consumes about four servings of protein daily. However, he may occasionally refuse a meal and typically accepts supplements. Friction and shear present a significant problem: Charley requires moderate to maximum assistance when moving. Due to his spasticity and contractures, he often slides down in bed, leading to almost constant friction and the need for frequent repositioning. This skin condition is further complicated by chronic pressure ulcers over both ischial tuberosities, with the left side currently suspected as infected.",
    "self_perception": "Charley is highly engaged in his own care and demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of activities of daily living, wound care, and mobility. Although physically limited, he remains proactive and hopeful about improving his condition, especially with the opportunity to work remotely and eventually hire professional home health assistance.",
    "coping_and_stress_tolerance": "Charley acknowledges frustration stemming from his physical condition but remains mentally resilient. He finds motivation in contributing through remote work and is determined to improve his independence with continued PT and OT. His ability to express limitations and plan for better care suggests mature coping strategies.",
    "sexuality_reproductive": "There is no specific mention of Charley's sexual or reproductive health. However, considering his age and medical condition, these aspects may be impacted by mobility and dependency. No current activity or concern in this domain has been reported.",
    "roles_relationships": "Charley’s primary caregivers are his aging parents, who assist him with all aspects of daily care including repositioning and wound management. Although their physical limitations hinder the adequacy of care, Charley maintains a respectful and appreciative relationship with them. He is hopeful that financial improvements from his new job will reduce their burden and enhance his support system."
